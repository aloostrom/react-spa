        <h2>About Carvana</h2>
            <p>At Carvana, we want to make sure you are satisfied. 
                We want to make sure our buyers are getting the best 
                deal for their purchase. We also believe that sellers 
                should get a fair price for their trade. 
            </p>
        <h2>Why Buy at Carvana?</h2>
            <p>All of our cars at Carvana are backed by the Carvana 
                guarantee. We make sure that all of the cars we sell 
                are single-owner cars with a clear CarFax&reg;. That's why 
                we're able to offer an extended service guarantee. 
                Every car at Carvana gets an extended 50,000 mile / 
                6-month warranty on top of any manufacturer warranty. 
                If you have any problems in this time, come into one 
                of our hundreds of dealerships across the U.S. for 
                repairs covered under warranty with no exceptions. 
                If we can't repair your car for you, we'll buy it 
                back from you. No questions asked. We also compare 
                the asking price to comparable sales in your area. 
                If we see that you could save money on the sale, we'll
                let you know with the Carvana price estimator.

        <h2>Why Sell to Carvana?</h2>
            <p>We couldn't do business without sellers. We want to 
                show our appreciation by making sure our sellers are 
                taken care of. We'll never try to low-ball your sale 
                to make an extra dollar. We want to make sure that you 
                get what your car is worth. We don't just advertise 
                for you. We buy your car on the spot. Each of our 
                sellers are required to provide some basic information
                on their cars. We'll reach out to you in a matter of 
                days to follow up on your offer to make an estimate. 
                When we follow up, we'll arrange for an appointment 
                so you can visit one of our dealerships. For a final
                inspection. Once inspected, we'll finalize the offer 
                for your sale.
